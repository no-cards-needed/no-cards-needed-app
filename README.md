# No Cards Needed

No Cards Needed currently is a React Game. You can use all the regular scripts and commands to start developing.

To install all packages, run the following command based on your package manager of choice.

`npm install`

`yarn install`

`pnpm install`

To then start the development server, run the following:

`npm start`

`yarn start`

`pnpm start`


## What needs to be done?

- [ ] The Stackorder of Cardstacks during the game sometimes breaks
- [ ] The current Game Lobby settings aren’t synced to all players (only visible to host)
- [ ] The whole firebase realtimedatabase thing isn’t the best thing. Ideally, we’d like to move to a [custom gameserver](https://github.com/no-cards-needed/no-cards-needed-server/tree/main
)
